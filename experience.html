              <p class="experience-summary">Last fall I was a software engineering intern at Facebook in Menlo Park.
              There, I worked on the Support Interfaces team under the Protect and Care org. I implemented a new
              Support Inbox item type that notifies victims of tag spam that the content they were tagged in was
              taken down by Facebook for spam. With this new feature, victims are now aware of the efforts that
              Facebook takes to make the platform more spam-free. By informing more people that action was taken
              against spam, this will hopefully encourage more spam reporting behavior. This was done with a little
              help from Hack (Facebook's PHP language), Haskell, SQL, and Thrift.</p>

              <p class="experience-summary">Last summer I interned with Google Search, on the Knowledge Panel team. I implemented a new type of knowledge graph answer box that delivers knowledge graph data. A hacky prototype of that plugin already existed from a year before, and I updated the prototype after underlying changes in infrastructure, fixed current issues, and added features. I quickly familiarized myself with a codebase containing hundreds of thousand lines of code, and used Java, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and protocol buffers throughout the summer to implement my project.</p>

There, I worked with two team members to create a Facebook 'Bookmark' feature through a Google Chrome extension. This feature adds a 'Bookmark' button in the Like/Share/Comment panel on Facebook, which allows users to save content to their own Bookmark Page to view later. Examples could include articles, videos, quotes, etc. that the user would like to save. Facebook's new 'Save' feature has this same functionality now.</p>

Holy Names Academy offers an AP Computer Science class, but I wanted to create a way for Holy Names students to stay interested in the field and hear about more opportunities within the tech industry outside of class as well. As a result, we created this forum to discuss Advanced Placement Computer Science topics and learn about opportunties in the computer-science field. This club is now in it's third iteration at Holy Names Academy, and keeps on growing with new leaders and more members every year.</p>

              <p class="experience-summary">Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference (QWCC) is a two-day conference that brings together top students from across the country to participate in workshops, network with Qualcomm employees, gain interview and career advice, and learn about the wireless industry. It is an opportunity to experience and apply what is learned in the classroom in a real world setting, while getting exposed to technologies we create that help connect people around the world, improve education, transform healthcare and enhance the lives of all who use it. Last year I was one of 30 computer science students from around the country sponsored to attend the first annual Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference.</p>
