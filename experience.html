              <p class="experience-summary">In high school I interned at Microsoft on the Translate Team within the Microsoft Research Division. Along with two other high school interns, I designed and implemented a web-based crossword puzzle game that helps people with language vocabulary. The game supports 35 different languages, is multi-player, and has multiple levels. I took part in the data, client, and server sides of the project.

Over the course of two weeks, I received two weeks of programming instruction from various Google engineers, and in the third week I worked with two peers to develop a web application using Google App Engine. Over the course of four days, my team created an online, multiplayer version of Cards Against Humanity, and added an additional feature to the game that allows users to enter their own cards.</p>

              <p class="experience-summary">The summer before my freshman year of college, I participated in my first college hackathon at Facebook, Seattle. There, I worked with two team members to create a Facebook 'Bookmark' feature through a Google Chrome extension. This feature adds a 'Library' button in the Like/Share/Comment panel on Facebook, which allows users to save content to their own Bookmark Page to view later. Examples could include articles, videos, quotes, etc. that the user would like to save.</p>

I answered questions, debugged code, and assisted in fun activities as many of the students experienced their first exposure to computer science through Processing, a Java-based language. I also later interviewed prospective counselors for summer 2014.</p>
