              <p class="experience-summary">Before I was introduced to computer science I wanted to become an astronaut. Although I plan to become a software developer now, I still have a great fascination in space and avidly follow the new discoveries and innovations within the space exploration industry.</p>
              <p>I am a NASA Space Grant Scholar at my University, and this program at the UW is designed to create a small college atmosphere within a larger university. Along with financial support, Space Grant scholars receive the opportunity to gain hands-on experience doing research in one of the many science or engineering laboratories on campus, attend monthly gatherings with other space grant scholars, and participate in the Space Grant mentor program which provides each scholar with a faculty, graduate student, or advanced peer mentor for academic guidance at the UW.</p>
              <p>In high school I was a Washington Aerospace Scholar my junior year and later became an ambassador my senior year. Through this program I engaged in a 6-month long online distance learning curriculum designed by NASA which included the past, present, and future of space exploration, as well as space craft engineering and design. I was one of the top students that qualified for the week-long summer instensive, where I engaged in designing a mock human mission to Mars, and also engaged in various engineering challenges, research, and presentations throughout the week.</p>
